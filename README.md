# Game-Of-Life
Java implementation of the Game Of Life

Initially, there is a grid with some cells which may be alive or dead. The next generation of cells will be generated based on the following rules: 
 
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under population.  
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.  
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.   
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
